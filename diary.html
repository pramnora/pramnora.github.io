    Around 2 days back, Saturday, I went and brought myself a brand 'new' pair of trainers; wondering to myself what I'm going to use it to do..? I haven't been doing any workouts for a long time now...so got an awful lot of catching up to get on with. The problem is I went and <i>paid</i> a whole lot of money to go and take lessons; but, most of the time, I just didn't even bother turning up...this always makes me feel really very guilty and ashamed. In fact, one doesn't even need to go out in order to 'keep fit'; but, at home, I tend to get very 'lazy', preferring to spend most of my time either watching TV/or else, surfing the internet; so, sometimes, I find it highly beneficial going out to take classes which actually encourages me to train alongside others.
